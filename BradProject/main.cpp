 * Some functions are very specific to C++11, such as "enum class" used in the parser.
 * Checklist from the midterm assignment description:
 * 
 * [ ] Memory allocation
 * [X] Functions with structures
 *      See "classes.h" The diceroller used in this system includes functions with
 *      structures. The gameclock is initialized and iterated in this way as well.
 * [X] Pointers with arrays and arrays of structures, internally as well as externally.
 *      The way that commands are processed and parsed demonstrates this with a character
 *      array.
