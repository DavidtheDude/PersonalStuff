/*
 * Using a map to list out possible permutations of commands, and associate
 * each command to a member of the enum class Noun, which I will then associate
 * to various actions in my final implementation of a parser.
 * 
 * A lot of help on building this text parsing function came from:
 * http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general//119658
 * 
 * and users at StackExchange in the following thread:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26455952/error-c-map-does-not-name-a-type/26455995#26455995
 * 
 * My use of the "auto" variable in parseNoun() is documented in the below:
 * http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-auto-decltype-return-value-after-function.html

/*
 * The verb.h header has a function which determines what verb is being used.
 * nouns.h will then decide what to do with the verb as it pertains to a particular
 * noun, which is passed from the verb parser.
